                    Our dynamic world with <strong>megatrends</strong> like digitalization, climate change, demographic
                    and social change etc. request from the people adapted skills and capabilities. Therefore, having a
                    <strong>growth mindset</strong>, <strong>being curious</strong> and
                    <strong>lifelong learning</strong> are essential for being able to cope with the future. A company
                    and its employees have to<strong> adapt to changing circumstances and roles</strong>. In a nutshell
                    it&rsquo;s about <strong>reskilling and upskilling</strong> of
                    <strong>soft skills and hard skills</strong>.

                  <p>
                    As an impactful changemaker I aim to
                    <strong>inspire people</strong> and to <strong>unleash their potential</strong>. Specifically, I
                    work on topics like <strong>leadership, strategy, sales and business development</strong>. Based on
                    close communication and trustful collaboration, I am
                    <strong>developing individuals and teams</strong> and this is what I am enjoying most in business

                    <strong>Business coaching</strong><br />Business coaching refers to a professional process in which
                    I support individuals in achieving their professional goals, improving performance, and reaching
                    their full potential. I focus on developing and strengthening the client's self-reflection and
                    leadership abilities.<br /><br />The benefits of business coaching are the opportunity to receive
                    customized support and guidance to address professional challenges and promote personal growth.
                    Coaching provides a structured and supportive environment to increase awareness of strengths and
                    areas for development, learn new skills, and promote the realization of goals. Through the process
                    of coaching, the client can unlock their professional potential and be more effective in their role.
                    <br /><br />It is important to note that business coaching is not a therapeutic intervention. It
                    focuses primarily on professional development and performance and aims to help the client achieve
                    their professional goals.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Business mentoring</strong><br />Business mentoring refers to a relationship in which I
                    share as a mentor my knowledge, experience in the fields of leadership, strategy, sales, business
                    development and advice with a less experienced person (mentee) to advance their professional
                    development and career. It is a structured process in which I use my expertise, insights and network
                    to help the mentee improve their skills, knowledge and leadership abilities. <br /><br />The
                    advantages of business mentoring lie in the opportunity for the mentee to benefit from my experience
                    and knowledge. By sharing information and ideas, the mentee can accelerate their professional
                    development, avoid mistakes, make more effective decisions, and expand their network.<br /><br />

                    <strong>Sales productivity workshops and sales trainings</strong><br />Companies need an
                    above-market growth to expand their position by comparison with their competitors, both in mature
                    markets and exploring new business opportunities. This requires a sales performance, both in growing
                    markets and in economic downturns.<br /><br />Success relies on the ability of the entire sales
                    organization to meet the complex, often unique business needs of individual customers. Therefore,
                    you have to develop specific skills and capabilities of the salespeople and the sales team for being
                    more effective and efficient. Teamwork is key to success.<br /><br />As a trainer I support sales
                    organizations to identify sales growth and efficiency measures within workshops and how to deal with
                    business opportunities within sales trainings. I give access to many tools &amp; methods I learned
                    in many trainings in Germany and the US. And I share my international experiences as sales
                    specialist and trainer gained in the past decades.

                    <strong>Business Coaching</strong><br />I use various methods and approaches to support clients in
                    achieving their goals and developing their skills. Here are some commonly used methods in business
                    coaching:

                    <ol class="with-space">
                      <li>
                        <strong>Questioning and reframing:</strong><br />I ask targeted questions to encourage the
                        client to think about their situation, gain new perspectives, and discover alternative
                        solutions. Through reframing, the client's perspective on a problem or challenge is changed to
                        uncover new possibilities.&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Goal setting:</strong><br />I assist the client in defining clear and specific goals
                        they want to achieve. These goals are formulated using the SMART criteria (specific, measurable,
                        achievable, relevant, and time-bound) and serve as a guiding point for the coaching process.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Feedback and feedforward:</strong><br />I provide the client with constructive feedback
                        on their performance, behavior, or communication. This feedback helps the client become aware of
                        areas for improvement and how to further develop their skills. Feedforward involves jointly
                        developing action alternatives for the future.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Role-playing and simulations:</strong><br />Role-playing or simulations can recreate
                        specific situations or challenges to allow the client to practice new skills, explore different
                        behaviors, and consider alternative solutions.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Self-reflection and self-awareness:</strong><br />I promote the client's self-reflection
                        to enhance their awareness of their strengths, values, beliefs, and behavioral patterns. Through
                        this self-awareness, they can better leverage their skills, competences and adapt their behavior
                        intentionally. The concrete competences we will work on will cover the 4 competence areas:
                        personal competence, socio-communicative competence, activity &amp; action competence, methods
                        &amp; professional competence.

                        through informal conversations, discussions, case studies, storytelling from my own career, or
                        sharing resources and readings.

                        their performance, skills, and behavior. This helps the mentee identify strengths and areas for

                        making connections, and building relationships. This can support the mentee in career
                        development, identifying opportunities, and accessing new possibilities.

                        that includes steps, milestones, and resources.

                    It is important to note that business mentoring is a personal relationship in which I tailor my
                    experiences and knowledge to the mentee's specific needs. The specific methods and approaches
                    employed may vary depending on the mentee's needs.

                    <strong>Sales productivity workshops and sales trainings</strong><br />
                    The basketball coach John Wooden said: &ldquo;<em
                      >Don't measure yourself by what you have accomplished, but by what you should have accomplished
                      with your ability</em
                    >.&rdquo; I am convinced that all people have talents, and the challenge is to develop them in order
                    to unleash their potential individually but also as a team. <br /><br />Like a coach in team sports
                    or a personal fitness coach I am working directly with people using different tools and methods
                    depending on the situation. It&rsquo;s about people and the most effective way is to meet and work
                    with them directly and live. As a complimentary form I offer also online sessions.&nbsp;

                        revenue with concrete customers or are enabling measures to improve efficiency and
                        effectiveness. All measures could occur additional costs. On Day 2 the team develops cost
