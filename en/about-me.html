                    interacts with teams, employees and also customers. If I need advice or an independent opinion Konstantin has always

                    was the future oriented view on targets and the transparent view of WHY, HOW and WHAT to do in order to get there.
                    Whenever I was seeking for guidance or had any concerns, Mr. Zois supported me on a timely and meaningful manner. What
