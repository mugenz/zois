							<h5>Academy - Developing people and unleash their potential</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p class="emphasized">My WHAT</p>
                            <p>Our dynamic world with <strong>megatrends</strong> like digitalization, climate change, demographic and social change etc. request from the people adapted skills and capabilities. Therefore, having a <strong>growth mindset</strong>, <strong>being curious</strong> and <strong>lifelong learning</strong> are essential for being able to cope with the future. A company and its employees have to<strong> adapt to changing circumstances and roles</strong>. In a nutshell it&rsquo;s about <strong>reskilling and upskilling</strong> of <strong>soft skills and hard skills</strong>.</p>
                            <p>As an impactful changemaker I aim to <strong>inspire people</strong> and to <strong>unleash their potential</strong>. Specifically, I work on topics like <strong>leadership, strategy, sales and business development</strong>. Based on close communication and trustful collaboration, I am <strong>developing individuals and teams</strong> and this is what I am enjoying most in business life.</p>
                            <p>My <strong>offering as a coach, mentor or trainer</strong> varies depending on the specific needs of an individual or an organization, and may include:</p>
                            <p><strong>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Business coaching</strong><br /> Business coaching refers to a professional process in which I support individuals in achieving their professional goals, improving performance, and reaching their full potential. I focus on developing and strengthening the client's self-reflection and leadership abilities.<br /> <br /> The benefits of business coaching are the opportunity to receive customized support and guidance to address professional challenges and promote personal growth. Coaching provides a structured and supportive environment to increase awareness of strengths and areas for development, learn new skills, and promote the realization of goals. Through the process of coaching, the client can unlock their professional potential and be more effective in their role. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that business coaching is not a therapeutic intervention. It focuses primarily on professional development and performance and aims to help the client achieve their professional goals.</p>
                            <p><strong>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Business mentoring</strong><br /> Business mentoring refers to a relationship in which I share as a mentor my knowledge and experience in the fields of leadership, strategy, sales, business development and advice with a less experienced person (mentee) to advance their professional development and career. It is a structured process in which I use my expertise, insights and network to help the mentee improve their skills, knowledge and leadership abilities. <br /> <br /> The advantages of business mentoring lie in the opportunity for the mentee to benefit from the mentor's experience and knowledge. By sharing information and ideas, the mentee can accelerate their professional development, avoid mistakes, make more effective decisions, and expand their network.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong></p>
                            <p><strong>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Sales productivity workshops and sales trainings</strong><br /> <br /> Companies need an above-market growth to expand their position by comparison with their competitors, both in mature markets and exploring new business opportunities. This requires a sales performance, both in growing markets and in economic downturns.<br /> <br /> Success relies on the ability of the entire sales organization to meet the complex, often unique business needs of individual customers. Therefore, you have to develop specific skills and capabilities of the salespeople and the sales team for being more effective and efficient. Teamwork is key to success.<br /> <br /> As a trainer I support sales organizations to identify sales growth and efficiency measures within workshops and how to deal with business opportunities within sales trainings. I give access to many tools &amp; methods I learned in many trainings in Germany and the US. And I share my international experiences as sales specialist and trainer gained in the past decades.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="emphasized">My HOW<br /> <em>&ldquo;Management is about coping with complexity and leadership is about coping with change and people&rdquo;.</em></p>
                            <p>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Business Coaching</strong><br /> I use various methods and approaches to support clients in achieving their goals and developing their skills. Here are some commonly used methods in business coaching:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>Questioning and reframing:</strong> <br /> I ask targeted questions to encourage the client to think about their situation, gain new perspectives, and discover alternative solutions. Through reframing, the client's perspective on a problem or challenge is changed to uncover new possibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Goal setting:</strong> <br /> I assist the client in defining clear and specific goals they want to achieve. These goals are formulated using the SMART criteria (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) and serve as a guiding point for the coaching process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback and feedforward:</strong> <br /> I provide the client with constructive feedback on their performance, behavior, or communication. This feedback helps the client become aware of areas for improvement and how to further develop their skills. Feedforward involves jointly developing action alternatives for the future.</li>
                            <li><strong>Role-playing and simulations:</strong> <br /> Role-playing or simulations can recreate specific situations or challenges to allow the client to practice new skills, explore different behaviors, and consider alternative solutions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-reflection and self-awareness:</strong> <br /> I promote the client's self-reflection to enhance their awareness of their strengths, values, beliefs, and behavioral patterns. Through this self-awareness, they can better leverage their skills, competences and adapt their behavior intentionally. The concrete competences we will work on will cover the 4 competence areas: personal competence, socio-communicative competence, activity &amp; action competence, methods &amp; professional competence.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Business mentoring</strong></p>
                            <p>I utilize various methods and approaches to support the mentee in their professional development and career advancement. Here are some commonly used methods in business mentoring:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> <br /> I share my knowledge, experiences, and expertise in the fields of leadership, strategy, sales, business development with the mentee. This can occur through informal conversations, discussions, case studies, storytelling from my own career, or sharing resources and readings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback and reflection:</strong> <br /> I provide constructive feedback to the mentee on their performance, skills, and behavior. This helps the mentee identify strengths and areas for development and reflect on how they can better leverage their professional potential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Networking:</strong> <br /> I can assist the mentee in expanding their professional network, making connections, and building relationships. This can support the mentee in career development, identifying opportunities, and accessing new possibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Career planning and goal setting:</strong> <br /> I can help the mentee establish career goals and develop strategies to achieve those goals. I can assist the mentee in creating a career plan that includes steps, milestones, and resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overcoming challenges:</strong> <br /> I support the mentee in overcoming professional challenges by providing insights, perspectives, and advice based on my experience. I can help the mentee consider different approaches and develop appropriate strategies for overcoming obstacles or difficulties.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skill development:</strong> <br /> I can assist the mentee in developing specific skills and competencies that are important for professional success. This can be done through recommendations for further education, training, or targeted coaching in specific areas.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>It is important to note that business mentoring is a personal relationship in which I tailor my experiences and knowledge to the mentee's specific needs. The specific methods and approaches employed may vary depending on the mentee's needs.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sales productivity workshops and sales trainings</strong></p>
                            <p>The basketball coach John Wooden said: &ldquo;<em>Don't measure yourself by what you have accomplished, but by what you should have accomplished with your ability</em>.&rdquo; I am convinced that all people have talents, and the challenge is to develop them in order to unleash their potential individually but also as a team. <br /> <br /> Like a coach in team sports or a personal fitness coach I am working directly with people using different tools and methods depending on the situation. It&rsquo;s about people and the most effective way is to meet and work with them directly and live. As a complimentary form I offer also online sessions.</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><strong>Sales productivity workshops:</strong> <br /> I conduct a 2-day workshop with the sales team. Day 1 the team develops sales stimulation measures that could either generate specific revenue with concrete customers or are enabling measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness. All measures could occur additional costs. On Day 2 the team develops cost efficiency measures for ensuring the sales productivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sales trainings:</strong> <br /> I conduct sales trainings that could cover topics like opportunity assessment, value selling, selling to senior executives, account business plans, intercultural approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Overall, <strong>my goal</strong> is to provide the client with the <strong>tools and strategies</strong> they need to <strong>be developed and unleash their potential</strong>.</p>
